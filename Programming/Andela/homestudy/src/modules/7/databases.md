---------

### ** Demonstrating an understanding of data bases **
A. **  When faced with a data modeling problem **
- I create the required table structures diagrammatically

B. **  When I require a subset of data from a table **
- I create SQL queries to extract the specific data needed

C. **  When I want to create table relationships **
- I specify a foreign key that identifies the related record in the related table

D. **  When I want to specify fields in a table design **
- I make use of data types adequately to ensure the data stored is well formatted

----------

### ** What do I need to believe about databases:? **
1. Databases should be used whenever I am solving a problem that requires persistent data
2. There is no one database solution that addresses all data storage needs
3. Investing time in structuring my data properly helps me create better performing applications
