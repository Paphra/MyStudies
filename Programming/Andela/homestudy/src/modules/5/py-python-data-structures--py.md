### **Demonstrating knowledge of data structures **
A. **  When designing a solution for a programming problem **
- I use the data structures that are most efficient for the needs of the problem

B. **  When using data structures that are already implemented in a programming language or framework **
-  I gain an understanding of how efficient the data structures are

----------

### **What do I need to believe about data structures:?**
1. The most efficient algorithms are built on most appropriate data structures for the problem
