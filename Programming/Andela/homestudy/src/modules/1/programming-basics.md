Aspiring Andelans know what a computer program is and understand the basics. They understand and can explain to their peers what programming is and the general programming concepts. They know the different models of programming, types of programming languages and can give examples of each model and type. They also have the capacity to identify and build the environment that enables them to code.

### **Behaviors that aid in learning programming**
A. **  When fellow learners approach me with basic questions on programming **
- I share my understanding of the concept with them in a way that they understand

B. **  When I come across a computer program:  **
- I identify the programming language used based on the statement syntax
- I identify the model of programming in use
- I identify the environment used for programming
- I identify the variables, data type and common operators used

C. ** Before I start writing a program: **
- I identify the problem I want to solve
- I identify the target platform where the program would be used
- I determine the model of programming that best suits the problem
- I identify the programming language I want to use based on the problem, target platform and programming model
- I identify the required software setup needed to write, compile and execute the program

## ** What do I need to believe about programming?: **
1. Programming is valuable to me as it affects technology and technology affects me
2. I can code in any language with the knowledge of core programming concepts
3. With computer programming, I can tell the computer to do what I want
4. By understanding basic programming concepts I have taken an important step to becoming a world class developer
